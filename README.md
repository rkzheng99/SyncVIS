# SyncVIS: Synchronized Video Instance Segmentation


## Visualization

### Fast-Moving Instances
In this part, we present you several cases showing that our model is capable of tracking and segmenting instances with greater velocity.

#### Racing Car
We demonstrate that our SyncVIS shows the ability of segmenting and tracking fast-moving racing cars with precision and consistency.

#### Skateboarding

### Failure Cases

As for limitations, our model has problem in segmenting very crowded or heavily occluded scenarios. Even though our model shows better performance in segmenting complex scenes with multiple instances and occlusions than previous approaches.
